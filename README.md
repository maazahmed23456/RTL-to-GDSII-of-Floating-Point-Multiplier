# RTL to GDSII ASIC Flow of Floating Point Multiplier
Complete RLT to GDSII flow of a multiplier architecture that operates upon IEEE 754 single precision floating point numbers

## A Glance at the FP Multiplier Architecture

A Floating-Point (FP) Multiplier is a crucial component in digital systems requiring high-performance arithmetic operations, such as digital signal processing, machine learning, and graphics processing. In VLSI design, an FP multiplier is implemented to perform multiplication of two floating-point numbers, adhering to the IEEE 754 standard. The architecture typically involves three stages: exponent addition, mantissa multiplication, and normalization. Exponent addition handles the biased exponents, while mantissa multiplication uses high-speed techniques like Wallace tree or Booth encoding to optimize the hardware and reduce critical path delay. The normalization stage ensures the result conforms to the IEEE standard by aligning the decimal point. Designing an efficient FP multiplier in VLSI requires optimizing trade-offs between power, performance, and area (PPA), making it a challenging task. Advanced techniques, such as pipelining, clock gating, and approximate computing, are often employed to enhance throughput and energy efficiency in modern ASIC or FPGA implementations.

</p>

It shows the FP Multiplier was synthesiszed by ustilisation of only 59 LUT and 2 DSP and 99 I/O ports which is fair utilization.

## Openlane Implementaions
The design was imported to Openlane on linux and a configuration script was developed which performed the synthesis to gds steps. Openlane is an open-source EDA tools that is used to perfrom the ASIC flow. The design was implemented by leveraging Skywater 130nm pdk.
